When using Google Drive through the Google Drive website a user cannot batch remove or change file permissions, they can only add multiple users at one time with the same permission role. With Drive Permission Manager a user is able to accomplish both of these things. Upon selecting a folder a user can view all permission holders for all files beneath it in the hierarchy.",
